There are three blocks of time allocated for Working Groups to meet and work.
These are currently:

* 1:00p-4:00p on 2017-10-06
* 9:00a-12:00p on 2017-10-07
* 1:00p-3:00p on 2017-10-07

Working Groups should plan to meet during these blocks of time.

## Opening Plenary

TBD

## Closing Plenary

There will be a closing Plenary session from 3:00p-5:00p on 2017-10-07 for
Working Groups to present on their status and progress. Every chartered
Working Group should plan on presenting *something* during this time, as it
is a fantastic opportunity for the WG to let the rest of the project know what
it is working on.
